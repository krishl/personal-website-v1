Technology has evolved immensely over the past two decades and people now have different sized devices to use at their disposal. 

While building a website, it is important to consider how it will look and behave on devices of all sizes. With responsive design, it is possible to make a website behave more like an app on smaller devices.

Another factor to keep note of is are the different browsers that users are able to use. All browsers handle code differently.

There are an infinite amount of browsers, but the main ones that are most often taken into consideration are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Opera. It is generally advised to support the last 2 or 3 major versions of all 6 browsers as a front end developer.
