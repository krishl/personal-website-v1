This week for my eCommerce project, I switched the webhost over to Siteground and also switched platforms over to Woocommerce on Wordpress.

I am mainly excited about the flexibility that Woocommerce provides, which is a huge step up from the previous eCommerce platform! It took about two days for the domain nameservers to completely propagate. I was also successful in activating the SSL certificate, which is a must for eCommerce. The initial platform set up was quick, and now I am beginning to learn the art of Wordpress. This will be a great opportunity for me to learn PHP, a language that I am just now beginning to learn. It seems to have many similarities to what I've learned throughout my time at Flatiron, so it doesn't seem like a daunting task at all.

I'm eager for the events to come!
