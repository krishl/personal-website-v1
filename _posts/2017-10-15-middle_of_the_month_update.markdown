It's the middle of October, and it's a perfect time to go through the things I'm currently up to!

I am currently embarking on a complete ecommerce website redesign. We plan to move to a better host and start the design from scratch. I have recently researched hosts and settled with the best one for our current needs. The new design should be a giant improvement since I am now a Flatiron School graduate with shiny new skills!

I am also reading through [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) to further solidify my knowledge of JavaScript. I've seen the book being recommended all the time. I started reading it recently, and so far I'm enjoying it! I like the book's concise explanations.

This week is TechWeek New York. I registered for the Explorer tickets, and plan to go to a few events over the week.
