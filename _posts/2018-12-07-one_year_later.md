It looks like it's been nearly a year since my last blog post! It's nice to be revisiting this blog once again.

I've recently came across this blog post on Hacker Noon, entitled [A 120 Days Plan to Become a Better Developer #120DaysBetterDev](https://hackernoon.com/a-120-days-plan-to-become-a-better-developer-120daysbetterdev-4c3bbbdf31ee).

In her blog post, Léna details a study plan that goes deep into the fundamentals of JavaScript and programming. Her plan utilizes many of the best online and offline resources according to her research. The topics covered in her study program look very interesting and thorough. Coming across her blog post felt like hitting gold, as I had also been trying to build my own study plan in recent days. Thanks to Léna's guide, as well as a few other promising resources I have come across through my preliminary research, I now feel confident in my goal to become a stronger developer.

I'm excited to blog about all the new information that I will learn through this study plan I am about to undertake. I've just started a [repo](https://github.com/krishl/javascript-notes) that will consolidate all of the study material and notes that will soon accumulate. Onward and upward!
