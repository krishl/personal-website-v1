Writing code is something I've experienced and enjoyed since the early years of my life. In elementary school, I only saw it as a hobby. It was very easy and fun that I thought anybody was able to do it. I started out by designing custom web pages or layouts on my most frequented websites using HTML and CSS. Creating web pages at the time was simply a creative outlet, where I got to make pages on the computer appear the way I wanted them to appear. I also had mastered Photoshop techniques shortly after by fulfilling approximately 1,500 user requests during my years in Junior High on a forum that I used to frequent, just so that I would be able to add even more to my web pages.

Years later, I revisited this hobby while in college by taking elective courses in introductory C++ and Python.

After graduating, I explored various careers that combined analytical thinking with creativity -- two things that I have always enjoyed throughout life. After broadening my career search beyond the economics field, which I had gotten a Bachelor's degree in, I eventually decided on pursuing software development. I knew that it would be perfect for me since all of my experiences involving coding so far have all been very positive.

I'm ready to take on the lifelong journey of learning and mastering the world of software development! Even though it will be tough at times, I will still be able to get through it in the end due to my sheer amount of rediscovered passion.
