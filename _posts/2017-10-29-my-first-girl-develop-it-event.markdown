Last week on October 25, **Girl Develop It** held an event at Flatiron School called **A Day in the Life of an Engineer: Career Changers Panel**. Seeing as how I am just starting my job search, I figured this event would be extremely helpful!

The panelists were all female bootcamp grads. 4 of the 5 graduaed from Dev Bootcamp, while 1 graduated from Flatiron School. They spoke about their transition into tech. It was great hearing about their experiences through their respective bootcamps, and hearing their advice on the job search process. I noticed a lot of their advice echoed the advice of the Career Services team at Flatiron School. They emphasized making connections with real people, being your naturally curious self, and more. The event was close to Halloween, so they offered candy for us to enjoy.

I learned a lot from this event. It definitely won't be my last.
