<p>With a natural inclination for technology throughout my life, I began coding website layouts and designing graphics on Photoshop at the age of 9, fulfilling 1,500 design requests online for free. During this time, I also helped my mother build and maintain an eCommerce website for her business.</p>

<p>I spent my high school years in Brooklyn Technical High School as a Chemical Engineering major, while also taking classes outside my major such as “Design & Drafting for Production,” “Introduction to Electricity,” and “Architectural Drawing.” Outside of school I developed an interest in Korean entertainment, strong enough that I wanted to help the English-speaking community by aiding in the English subtitling process. I taught myself Korean and volunteered in several subtitling teams, taking charge of the segmenting and video encoding processes. I also created 300+ GIFs from these shows using Photoshop and ran contests for the online community.</p>

<p>I majored in Economics at Hunter College and was elected as Webmaster for the pre-dental club by my sophomore year. Toward the end of college I got the opportunity to take elective courses such as “Introduction to Computer Science,” “Computers and Money,” and “Introduction to Python,” all of which amplified my interest in computer technology.</p>

<p>After graduating, I explored careers that combined technology with analytical thinking and creativity – three skills that I have honed and enjoyed throughout my life. After evaluating the culmination of my past experiences, I became a full stack web developer and I am now committed to pursuing a career as a software developer.</p>
